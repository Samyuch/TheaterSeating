# TheaterSeating

**Program Description**

This program parses a theater layout and a list of ticket requests and produce a list of tickets or explanations in the same order as the requests.
 
few rules to follow 
1.	Fill as many orders as possible
2.	Put parties as close to the front as possible.
3.	If there are not enough seats available in the theater to handle a party, tell them "Sorry, we can't handle your party."
4.	Each party must sit in a single row in a single section.  If they won't fit, tell them "Call to split party".
 
The theater layout is made up of 1 or more rows.  Each row is made up of 1 or more sections separated by a space.

After the theater layout, there is one empty line, followed by 1 or more theater requests.  The theater request is made up of a name followed by a space and the number of requested tickets.

Your program must produce results to standard output in the same order as the requests, with the name of the person who requested the ticket and either the row and section of the ticket or the explanations "Sorry, we can't handle your party" or "Call to split party."
